      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Great side dish that doesn't take long to prepare and has lots of flavor. Don't cook the bacon too much; you don't want it to have a crunchy texture. This makes excellent leftovers!</p>
   
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <li>3 cups water</li>
      <li>3 cups instant white rice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>12 slices bacon</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped green onion</li>
      <li>1/2 cup soy sauce, or to taste</li>
      
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Stir instant white rice into boiling water.Cook rice until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fry bacon in a large wok or skillet over medium-high until hot and cooked through but not yet crunchy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove bacon to a plate lined with paper towels. Drain fat from wok, reserving 1 to 2 tablespoons of drippings in the bottom of the wok. Cut bacon into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Return wok to medium-high heat and heat reserved bacon drippings. Combine rice, chicken, bacon, green onions, and soy sauce in the wok; cook and stir until evenly mixed and hot, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
      </ol>
