      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Victoria sponge cake, a much loved English layer cake, is perfect for any occasion!</p>
     
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>160g flour</li>
        <li>2 level tsp. baking powder</li>
        <li>120g margarine</li>
        <li>120g caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2-3 drops vanilla essence</li>
        <li>cold water to mix</li>
        <li>2 tblsp. smooth jam</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease 2 sandwich cake tins with oil or unsalted fat and dredge with a little flour.</li>
        <li>Cream margarine and sugar with essence.</li>
        <li>Sieve flour and baking powder together onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Lightly beat eggs in a small basin.</li>
        <li>Add egg gradually to the creamed mixture, beating well between each addition (a little flour may be added to prevent curdling).</li>
        <li>When all the egg has been added, cease beating and fold in the remainder of the flour a little at a time. Add cold water to keep mixture of dropping consistency.</li>
        <li>Divide mixture equally between the two tins and spread lightly.</li>
        <li>Bake 30–40 minutes. When cooked, the cakes should be well risen, golden brown, and slightly shrunken from sides of tins.</li>
        <li>Cakes should respond to the fingertip test.</li>
        <li>Allow cakes to cool completely on a cooling rack, and then sandwich the two together with the jam. Dredge the top with fine sugar.</li>
      </ol>
